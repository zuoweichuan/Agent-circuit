## Mimi\_Agent\RL
This folder contains our small-scale pre training and reinforcement learning process from scratch. You can set our training method in Train.py
```bash
# First run the data/prepare.py
python prepare.py

# Then run Train.py to train the model
python Train.py

# The object circuit is at temp.v
```
